Crop Disease Classification Model - Documentation
--------------------------------------------------

 Description:
This model is trained using a RandomForestClassifier to predict the type of disease affecting a crop, based on environmental conditions and crop type.

 Input Features:
The model expects a preprocessed (label-encoded and scaled) array with the following features:
1. crop_type (encoded as integer)
2. temperature (Celsius)
3. humidity (%)
4. soil_moisture
5. rainfall (mm)
6. pH_level

Example Input:
[0, 25.4, 80.2, 30.1, 10.3, 6.8]

 Output:
The model outputs a predicted class label such as:
- rust
- leaf_blight
- healthy

 Files Included:
- crop_disease_model.pkl → Trained model (via joblib)
- model_info.txt → This documentation

 Example Code to Use the Model:
```python
import joblib
import numpy as np
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib (used during training for visualization)
seaborn (used during training for visualization)


# Input (after label encoding & scaling)
input_data = np.array([[0, 25.4, 80.2, 30.1, 10.3, 6.8]])

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(input_data)
print("Predicted disease label:", prediction)
